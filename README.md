```
It is created using: HTML, CSS, JS, free 2D Game engine, and assets from https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-png.
The game contains three levels of different elements. 
The player starts with a basic attack spell and acquires new spells as they progress through levels.
The player has a health and mana bar which is used for special spell attacks.
You slowly recover mana but for health, you need to get health potions. 
Each level represents a unique elemental realm for example Fire, Water, and Earth. The mobs in each level fit the elemental theme of the level.
The mobs have a rare drop that they drop a health/mana potion when you kill them. The levels increase in difficulty as the player progresses. 
Each level has a unique set of mobs and final bosses which include item drops from these bosses. The items the boss can drop are items that upgrade your spells. 
The User interface shows the player's health/mana. In addition to fighting mobs, there was jumping between platforms involved where if you jumped and missed you had to restart the level. 
Designed each level with the platforms, obstacles, and enemy placements. Created a few original 2D assets like spells, items, and platforms using online 2D pixel art creators.
For collisions square collision detection. Each mob had a radius, if the player got within that range, the mob would approach the player.
Once close enough there was another collision detection with an attack radius that detected if the enemy was in that radius and started attacking.
